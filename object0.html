      <h1>âš¡ The FASTEST way to learn coding</h1>
      <p>What I learned from working at big tech is that you donâ€™t really need a computer science degree to become a software engineer. For example, one of my colleagues used to be a US navy officer. His first job after completing a coding bootcamp? A software engineer at Microsoft. What if your degreeâ€™s in literature? Doesnâ€™t matter. You just need the right skills and commitment to set your foot in the industry. 

        Knowing what I know today, what would I do differently if I could go back in time? How would I optimize my path in becoming a software engineer? Here, Iâ€™m sharing the fastest way to go from 0 to a FULL-TIME software engineer for FREE.</p>

      <h2>ðŸ’¡ About the Curriculum</h2>
      <p>I put the courses together to give everyone an equal opportunity to learn coding without paying a hefty tuition. This curriculum does NOT guarantee a spot in the industry; as with all things, it takes effort and commitment. The best way to learn to code is to do it. I encourage you to follow along with each video, writing the code yourself and pausing in between until you fully understand what they teach. Coding is not an easy endeavor, but with perseverance, powerful determination, and unbending resolve, Iâ€™m confident anyone can realize their dreams. Happy coding. Good luck. ðŸ‘‘</p>
